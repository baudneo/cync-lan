Devices known to work, kind of work, and known not to work are listed here.

# Known Good

- Cync: direct connect bulbs (Full color, Decorative, white temp, dimmable, edison)
- Cync/C by GE: Bluetooth only bulbs \**needs at least 1 wifi device to act as a bridge*
- Cync: Indoor smart plug (outdoor should also work)

# Known Bad
- Cameras: I have none and do not intend to support them.
- Basically anything with a battery as its power source. They use BTLE and are not supported by this script **yet**.
    - Wire free switch OR dimmer [white temp control].
    - Sensors

# Future devices
Devices I do not own, but would like to add support for. If you can get me good `socat` logs, I can add support for them.
- Light strips
- Hexagon panels
- Dynamic lights
- Wired switch [motion sensor and ambient light sensor]
- Fan controller
